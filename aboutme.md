My name is Barış Tutakli. I graduated from Galatasaray University, Department of Mathematics. Currently, i take web and mobile software developer training courses funded by the Turkish government. Additionally, I’m following courses on Patika.dev, coderbyte and Kodlama.io. My motivation is to produce software solutions using human centered design methods. While continuing the courses I mentioned above, I also give design thinking courses as a volunteer of the association Habitat.</p>
